### Authentication & authorization

This section describes all interactions with API authentication.
API uses JWT to authenticate any request and Facebook Token to create JWT.

#### Getting the Facebook Token

To get the Facebook Token you need to know the client id of API.
In order to get it, you can perform:

`GET /oauth2/facebook/v15.0`

As a response, you will get:

<pre>
{
    "clientId": "CLIENT_ID",
    "redirectUri": "REDIRECT_URI",
    "tokenRequestUrl": "https://www.facebook.com/v15.0/dialog/oauth?client_id=CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI&response_type=token"
}
</pre>

Follow the link presented in `tokenRequestUrl`, pass the Facebook authentication, and you will be redirected to `redirectUri` with your facebook token as `access_token` URL param.  

#### Getting the JWT

To perform any authenticated or authorized request you should provide your Facebook Token to the next endpoint:

`POST /authenticate`

With requiered data parameter `{"facebookToken": "EAAHC..."}`.

As the response you will get JSON Web Token as
<pre>
{
  "token": "eyJhb..."
}
</pre>

The possible exceptions are:
- 401 - bad_facebook_token_exception
- 401 - bad_credentials

Gained JWT should be put in request header as a parameter `Authorization` with value `Bearer eyJhb...`.

#### Edge cases

You can face next exceptions while using JWT within your request:
- 401 - not_authenticated_exception 
- 401 - bad_token_exception
- 401 - expired_token_exception
- 401 - bad_token_signature_exception
- 401 - malformed_token_exception
- 401 - unsupported_token_exception
- 403 - access_denied_exception

#### Users
There are four groups of users:
- Guests - users without authentication
- Candidates - users that have passed authentication but have not Interviewer or Coordinator role
- Interviewers - users that have passed authentication and have Interviewer role
- Coordinator - users that have passed authentication and have Coordinator role

#### User obtention endpoint
Interviewers and Coordinators can perform next endpoint to obtain their user information:

Request: `GET /me`

Response:
<pre>
{
  "email": "example@google.com",
  "role": "INTERVIEWER",
  "id": 123
}
</pre>

The `id` field is present only for users with `INTERVIEWER` or `COORDINATOR` roles.

### Implemented API
This section describes all already implemented business logic endpoints. Section is divided by users.

#### Guest
Guests can only get current and next week of num or [authenticate](#authentication--authorization)

Requests:
- `DELETE /users/interviewers/{id}` - to revoke interviewer role by id
- `DELETE /users/coordinators/{id}` - to revoke coordinator role by id

URL parameters:
- `id` - id of user to delete

## Setting-up the project
This section describes all needed steps to launch the application.
You can set up the project as it is via [docker](#configuring-docker) or via [your IDE](#running-via-ide).

### Getting the project
First of all, you need to get the project. You can do this by two ways:
- [Getting zip project file](#getting-zip-project-file)
- [Cloning the repository](#cloning-the-repository)

#### Getting zip project file
To download project in zip follow the [link](https://github.com/GrEFeRFeeD/intellistart-java-2022-oneweek/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

After downloading, unzip the archive and go to __intellistart-java-2022-oneweek-main__ directory.

#### Cloning the repository
To clone the repository run the console and type:

`git clone https://github.com/GrEFeRFeeD/intellistart-java-2022-oneweek.git`

After cloning is done change the directory to __intellistart-java-2022-oneweek-main__ by the following command:

`cd intellistart-java-2022-oneweek-main`

### Configuring docker
This section describes all needed steps to launch application via docker.

#### Configuring environmental variables
Before launching the application via docker, you need to created `api.env` file with next environment variables.
The example of such file represented in `example.env` file. The needed variables are:
- `APPLICATION_PORT` - port on which application will be run
- `JWT_SECRET` - defines secret work to assign the JWT
- `JWT_VALIDITY` - validity of JWT in seconds
- `JWT_CACHING` - how long JWT will be cached in seconds
- `FIRST_COORDINATOR_EMAIL` - facebook account attached email of first coordinator that will be automatically added to DB  
- `FACEBOOK_CLIENT_ID` - application client id provided by facebook
- `FACEBOOK_SECRET` - application secret provided by facebook
- `FACEBOOK_REDIRECT_URI` - URI to which you will be redirected after oauth2. Configures by facebook application
- `HIBERNATE_DDL_AUTO` - hibernate DDL launch mode:
  - `validate`: validates the schema, makes no changes to the database.
  - `update`: updates the schema.
  - `create`: creates the schema, destroying previous data.
  - `create-drop`: drop the schema when the SessionFactory is closed explicitly, typically when the application is stopped.
  - none: does nothing with the schema, makes no changes to the database.
- `DATABASE_PORT` - port on which database will be run
- `POSTGRES_USER` - name of default postgresql user
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` - password of default postgresql user
- `POSTGRES_DB` - postgresql database name
- `REDIS_HOSTNAME` - hostname of the server to connect redis DB
- `REDIS_PORT` - port of the given hostname to connect redis DB

#### Launching the application
Once the `api.env` is created with proper variables you can launch docker with application through running the following command:

`docker-compose --env-file api.env up`

### Running via IDE

Open the [gained from repository](#getting-the-project) project with your IDE.

After you open the project, set up the 11 JDK do the `maven clean` operation.

You can launch the application with [all needed environmental variables](#configuring-environmental-variables) by configuring them in your IDE.
In this case you need to set up the PostgreSQL database with appropriate __POSTGRES_USER__, __POSTGRES_PASSWORD__, __DATABASE_PORT__ and __POSTGRES_DB__ values. 

As an option you can launch the application without the inner DBMS. In order to do that, replace your __/src/main/resources/application.yml__ configuration file with:
<pre>
server:
  port: ${APPLICATION_PORT}

jwt:
  secret: ${JWT_SECRET}
  validity: ${JWT_VALIDITY}

first-coordinator-email: ${FIRST_COORDINATOR_EMAIL}

spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        registration:
          facebook:
            clientId: ${FACEBOOK_CLIENT_ID}
            clientSecret: ${FACEBOOK_SECRET}
            redirectUri: ${FACEBOOK_REDIRECT_URI}

  jpa:
    show-sql: true
    generate-ddl: true
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: ${HIBERNATE_DDL_AUTO}
</pre>

In such case you still must satisfy next environmental variables:
- APPLICATION_PORT
- JWT_SECRET
- JWT_VALIDITY
- JWT_CACHING
- FIRST_COORDINATOR_EMAIL
- FACEBOOK_CLIENT_ID
- FACEBOOK_SECRET
- FACEBOOK_REDIRECT_URI
- REDIS_HOSTNAME
- REDIS_PORT

Execute the __com.intellias.intellistart.interviewplanning.InterviewPlanningApplication__ class in order to run the project.

## Additional materials
This section describes all additional information about the project that does not match the topics below and materials putted to __/docs__ directory of the repository.

### Postman collection
The project has [Postman collection](https://github.com/GrEFeRFeeD/intellistart-java-2022-oneweek/tree/main/docs/postman) to demonstrate the work of implemented endpoints. 

### Performance testing
The project has passed performance testing with JMeter.

The performance profile could be found by the [link](https://github.com/GrEFeRFeeD/intellistart-java-2022-oneweek/tree/main/docs/jmeter).

To run the tests, put the StartDataLoader in __com.intellias.intellistart.interviewplanning.initialization__ instead of already existed file.
